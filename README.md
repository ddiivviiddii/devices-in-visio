# devices-in-visio
Automatic device creation in MS Visio

This VBA code creates shape 'device' with named inputs/outputs in Visio. 
Usage:

Call DrawDevice(x, y) where x and y are coordinates in mm where you want to place it.

Code is dirty and not optimal as I'm not a developer and created it quickly for internal use.
